			<p>I'm a video game programmer who last year graduated from the University of Nottingham with an Upper Second Class degree in Physics. Although I've been playing video games since childhood and thinking about them more critically as I got older, I hadn't thought I would go on to make them. I guess I was intimidated by the complexity of it. So when I decided to study a Physics degree in Nottingham it was almost in spite of the mandatory computing course they offered. But to my surprise the more I learned the more I enjoyed the methodical process of solving problems using programming. In second year the training wheels were taken off and we used programming as an integral part of conducting experiments. It was this newfound sense of agency and capableness that made me decide to learn C# in my free time and code games in Unity. I would code games off and on, but when I went to live for a year in Munich as part of an Erasmus scheme I had a lot more time to experiment. By the time I started my last year at university I was confident enough in my ability that I decided to learn Python and to undertake a Computing subject for my final year project, called 'Fluctuations In Active Matter'. This involved simulating thousands of boid-like particles obeying simple rules which resulted in large-scale emergent phenomena, namely flocking. This was the first time I was really tasked with optimising a simulation, and it was an interesting challenge. I'm still thinking of a way to turn it into a game mechanic.</p>
			<p>After graduating I've been learning C++ by making games using SDL/OpenGL. After all this time this kind of low level control has been really gratifying. The part about making games that really excites me is having an idea in your head that you can then put on the screen, see it move and poke it around to see how it reacts.</p>
