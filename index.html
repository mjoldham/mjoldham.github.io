			<h4>A retro-future noir detective game set in Munich, made with Unity.</h4>
			<p><a href="https://github.com/mjoldham/trystero/tree/develop">GitHub Repo</a>
			<p>I worked on this project on and off quite soon after I started learning to make games with the Unity Engine around the start of 2017. In the time since then the game was overhauled a number of times as I learned more about the engine and coding in general, but also as the overall design of the game evolved and I understood more what it was really about. The core idea is to use non-verbal actions to communicate with NPCs and to use information to progress.<p>
			<p>Currently it's still in development: all the text for dialogue is implemented as well as most of the logic driving the dialogue system and world, however animations with items for the player character haven't been properly implemented, sprites for the NPC haven't been put in, and there are some unresolved bugs with the NPC dialogue. Despite that the game is playable from start to finish.</p>
			<p>Something I learnt about myself in doing this particular project is that I'm very willing to change tack to follow what I find most interesting and cut features if they don't support the game's core ideas: the game was originally a lot more about gunfights using cover and dodging mechanics, but it also included the idea for communicating with NPCs non-verbally. When thinking about the game it would be the latter part that sparked my imagination the most, and I realised working on the former would not only waste time, but actually be detrimental to the core experience.</p>
